            My Interests mostly lie in learning coding and learn the importance of AI in Tech. I found out about coding during my 7th grade when java was introduced in our syllabus. From the beginning itself,the subject raise interest. Maybe that was the reason why I gained the confidence to learn coding in technical aspects. Coding was a bit complicated at the beginning, but once I got hang out of it, it seems interesting. Now talking about Badminton, it is something that I loved way earlier than coding. If I remember it correctly, it was during my 5th grade that I first joined an Badminton class and continued that for four whole years.Badminton was like my safe place. Maybe now also they are the same. Apart from these two, I also love Reading Books.It keeps me busy and help in gaining reading skills for me.
